BEGIN BEGIN Coming to the point, [DORAN] asks [JAIME] why he has snuck in to [DORNE] to abduct [MYRCELLA] back to King's [LANDING] END END BEGIN BEGIN He says he feared for her safety, but when [DORAN] insists why he didn't just send a letter by messenger-raven, he explains that they received a threatening message: [MYRCELLA]'s [LANNISTER] lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper END END BEGIN BEGIN [DORAN] glares at [ELLARIA], while a confused [MYRCELLA] explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room END END 
BEGIN BEGIN [JAIME] asks if [DORAN] intends to behead him, but (acting more sympathetic now that [JAIME] revealed he was threatened first) he says that he will not, because he wishes to avoid war END END BEGIN BEGIN He has seen what war can do, bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at home, and he will not lead his people into that END END BEGIN BEGIN [ELLARIA] bluntly asks what he will do, break bread with the [LANNISTER]s?

BEGIN BEGIN [DORAN] asks if [TOMMEN] indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital, and [JAIME] politely says he does, to which [DORAN] says he cannot disobey his king - [MYRCELLA] will return to King's [LANDING] END END BEGIN BEGIN She is upset for a moment, but then [DORAN] explains his solution: his son [TRYSTANE] will go along with them, to take over the seat on the [SMALL_COUNCIL] which Tywin granted to [OBERYN], but which was vacated by his death END END BEGIN BEGIN [DORAN] insists that for the alliance between the [IRON_THRONE] and [DORNE] to continue, the engagement of [TRYSTANE] and [MYRCELLA] must stand, and [TRYSTANE] will simply take his uncle [OBERYN]'s place on the [SMALL_COUNCIL] END END BEGIN BEGIN [JAIME] finds [DORAN]'s request entirely reasonable, and [MYRCELLA] is ecstatic that she will not be separated from [TRYSTANE], so [JAIME] agrees END END BEGIN BEGIN [ELLARIA] gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that [DORAN] cannot stand, because he has no spine END END BEGIN BEGIN As she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice, saying that she is the mother of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again, she will not END END 
BEGIN BEGIN [JAIME] then asks what fate will befall [BRONN], who is still imprisoned END END BEGIN BEGIN [BRONN] punched out [TRYSTANE] when they tried to take [MYRCELLA], and [JAIME] is asked what the normal punishment is for striking a prince where he is from END END BEGIN BEGIN [JAIME] politely insists that [BRONN] was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following [JAIME]'s commands END END BEGIN BEGIN [TRYSTANE] agrees, saying he has learned the value of mercy from his father, but that he has one "condition" END END

BEGIN BEGIN Later, in the courtyard, [AREO] brings [ELLARIA] and the Sand Snakes before [PRINCE_DORAN] in his wheelchair END END BEGIN BEGIN [DORAN] gives [ELLARIA] an ultimatum: she can either choose to swear allegiance to him (and that she will not try something like this again), or she can choose death END END BEGIN BEGIN Restraining tears, she kneels and kisses his hand END END BEGIN BEGIN [DORAN] says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven - but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances END END 
BEGIN BEGIN [ELLARIA] then finds [JAIME] in a study writing a letter back to King's [LANDING] informing of his return END END BEGIN BEGIN He writes very poorly, given that he is using his non-dominant left hand, and [ELLARIA] remarks that he writes like a seven year old END END BEGIN BEGIN [ELLARIA] notes how odd it is that she and [OBERYN] were looked down on for their sexuality in King's [LANDING], and [JAIME] is scorned for his incestuous love for [CERSEI] - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago, if his name were [TARGARYEN], no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship END END BEGIN BEGIN Cryptically (perhaps spurred by [DORAN]), she then says that she knows "your daughter" [MYRCELLA] had no part in what befell [OBERYN], and maybe even [JAIME] is innocent of that (and indeed he is, as [OBERYN] volunteered for the trial by combat) END END BEGIN BEGIN She exits, and [JAIME] is left to ponder what seems to be her apology END END

BEGIN BEGIN Somewhere else [IN_THE_RIVERLANDS], [JAIME] [LANNISTER] and [BRIENNE] of [TARTH] have been taken captive by [LOCKE] and a detachment of men from [HOUSE_BOLTON] END END BEGIN BEGIN As they ride along, the men sing a rousing chorus of The Bear and the Maiden Fair END END BEGIN BEGIN Tied up back to back on one of the horses, [JAIME] warns [BRIENNE] that when they make camp for the night, they will rape her, more than once, and that his honest advice is to give no resistance, and just think of [RENLY] END END BEGIN BEGIN They were only sent to capture [JAIME], therefore [BRIENNE] means nothing to them, so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation END END BEGIN BEGIN [BRIENNE] says she will fight even if they kill her, and [JAIME] agrees that if he were a woman, he would fight to the death before being raped, too END END
